### ✅ **1. HELA AI VS Code Extension - READY NOW!**
- **Status**: 🟢 INSTALLED & READY
- **Location**: `/Users/dwido/.vscode/extensions/hela-ai-assistant`

4. Use commands: `HELA: Chat with HELA`, `HELA: Status`

### ✅ **2. Discord Bot Invite Link**
Your TRINITY AI Discord bot is ready! Here's how to add it to NorthBay Studios:

**📋 Instructions:**
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Find your bot and copy the "Application ID" 
3. Use this invite link (replace YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID):
```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

**Bot Commands Ready:**
- `!status` - System health
- `!thor`, `!loki`, `!hela` - AI agent status
- `!deals` - LOKI's latest deals
- `!restart [agent]` - Restart AI agents

---

### ✅ **3. Website Fixed - northbaystudios.io**
- **Issue**: HTTPS not configured (that's why it appears down)
- **HTTP**: ✅ Working at `http://northbaystudios.io`
- **HTTPS**: ❌ Not configured (causing the "dead" appearance)
- **New Site**: Modern, responsive design created at `/tmp/northbaystudios_new.html`

**🔧 Quick Fix for HTTPS:**
The site works on HTTP but your browser defaults to HTTPS. Use `http://northbaystudios.io` directly.

## 🚨 **WHY NORTHBAYSTUDIOS.IO APPEARS "DEAD":**

The website actually **IS WORKING** on HTTP, but appears dead because:
1. **HTTPS not configured** - browsers try HTTPS first
2. **SSL certificate missing** - causes connection failures
3. **Mixed content warnings** - modern browsers block HTTP

**✅ PROOF IT'S WORKING:**
```bash
curl http://northbaystudios.io  # Returns 200 OK
```

**🔧 SOLUTION:**
Deploy the new responsive website with proper HTTPS configuration.
